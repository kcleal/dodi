====

dodi chooses an optimal set of alignments from a candidate list. This can be used for
improving split-read mapping, or for selectively mapping to target regions of the genome

Installation
------------
Install using::

    $ git clone https://github.com/kcleal/dodi.git; cd dodi
    $ pip install .


Requires Python>=3.6, cython and >=c++11 compiler.


Usage
-----
Given a list of candidate alignments in `.sam` format, `dodi` will select an optimal spanning set of
alignments. Common usage is to run `dodi` in a pipe, downstream of a mapper such as bwa mem or Last.

To use with bwa mem, make sure the `-a` flag is used, to report all alignments::

    $ bwa mem -a -t8 ref.fa read1.fq read2.fq | dodi - > output_alignments.sam

To selectively map to target regions of the genome, supply dodi with a .bed file containing the
target regions, and a `--bias` value (default is 1.15). Alignments falling within target
regions receive a temporary bias to their alignment scores, meaning those alignments are
more likely to be chosen by dodi::

    $ bwa mem -a -t8 ref.fa read1.fq read2.fq | \
            dodi --include target_regions.bed - > output_alignments.sam


For long-read mapping, a lower --bias value is recommended, e.g. 1.01
